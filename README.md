## The card game everyone has played

*We are currently developing this game...*

**UPDATED 12/6/2015 - version 0.5-beta ready:** 
The game is now fully in English and all the bugs have been fixed.
Now includes amount of players selection and help section too.

**UPDATED 12/2/2015:** 
Finally, the base game is working and by now there is not any reported
issue. There are more things to add, as the sectarian players, and, of
course, the UI.
We will update the *master* branch once we have ready each one of these
functions, and we will keep updated the different branches with our daily
progress, as the Ruby version on https://github.com/dvcarrillo/napakalaki-ruby.
